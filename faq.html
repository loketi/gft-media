<p><strong>What distinguishes cold email outreach from email marketing?</strong></p>
<p>Cold email outreach involves initiating contact with individuals you don’t yet know, akin to making a cold call but via email. This approach uses specific mailboxes to reach out to potential prospects.</p>
<p>Email marketing, on the other hand, involves sending emails to recipients who have opted into your subscription list. These can include newsletters, receipts, reminders, etc., typically sent using platforms like Brevo or Klaviyo.</p>
<p><strong>Isn’t cold emailing just spam? How do you ensure your emails reach the inbox?</strong></p>
<p>Cold email outreach is a strategic method for proposing business partnerships. Unlike unsolicited mass emails from irrelevant companies, we focus on personalized and relevant communication. Our approach includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Proper set-up and warm-up of your sending domain.</li>
<li>Ensuring your prospect list is clean, current, and targeted.</li>
<li>Crafting messaging that resonates with your prospects.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How does your cold email outreach comply with international data privacy laws?</strong></p>
<p>Our process is designed to comply with the Data Protection Act of 2019, CASL, GDPR, and CCPA. We only email business addresses, include an opt-out link in all communications, and avoid emailing individuals who have previously opted out. Additionally, we ensure all messages are relevant and professional.</p>
<p><strong>What should be the average deal size for cold emailing ideal prospects?</strong></p>
<p>For optimal results, your product/service should have an average annual contract value of at least USD$3,000. If your deal size is below this threshold, while you can still use cold emailing to attract new customers, hiring us may not be economically feasible.</p>
<p><strong>Do you provide data for our ideal prospects when conducting outbound cold emails?</strong></p>
<p>We can recommend various data vendors based on your needs or handle the data acquisition ourselves, billing you accordingly. The cost will vary depending on the type and quantity of information required.</p>
<p><strong>Do you use proprietary tools?</strong></p>
<p>We utilize a range of well-known SaaS products to set up and manage your campaigns. A detailed tool list will be provided during our onboarding call.</p>

The average spend with us is about USD$6,000 per quarter. We recommend a minimum commitment of 3 months to fully implement our process.</p>
